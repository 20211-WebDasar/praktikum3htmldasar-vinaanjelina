        What Is Android?
    </h1>
    <img src="Images/a.jpg" style="margin-left: 46%; width: 7%;">
    <p align = "center">
        Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on 
        a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software 
        and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones 
        and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for 
        televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, 
        each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used 
        on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and other electronics. Initially 
        developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled 
        in 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008. 
        The operating system has since gone through multiple major releases, with the 
        current version being 9 "Pie", released in August 2018.

    <b>Interface</b> 
    <p align = "left">
        Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using 
        touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, 
        pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual 
        keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth 
        or USB. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid 
        touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic 
        feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity 
        sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example 
        adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented or 
        allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating 
        control of a steering wheel.
    </p>
    <b>Applications</b>
    <p align = "center">
        Applications ("apps"), which extend the functionality of devices, are written using the Android 
        software development kit (SDK) and, often, the Java programming language. Java may be combined 
        with C/C++, together with a choice of non-default runtimes that allow better C++ support. The Go 
        programming language is also supported, although with a limited set of application programming 
        interfaces (API). In May 2017, Google announced support for Android app development in the Kotlin 
        programming language <br>
        Android has a growing selection of third-party applications, which can be acquired by users by 
        downloading and installing the application's APK (Android application package) file, or by downloading 
        them using an application store program that allows users to install, update, and remove applications 
        from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that 
        comply with Google's compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software. Google 
        Play Store allows users to browse, download and update applications published by Google and third-party 
        developers; as of July 2013, there are more than one million applications available for Android in Play 
        Store. As of July 2013, 50 billion applications have been installed. Some carriers offer direct carrier 
        billing for Google Play application purchases, where the cost of the application is added to the user's 
        monthly bill. As of May 2017, there are over one billion active users a month for Gmail, Android, Chrome, 
        Google Play and Maps
    </p>
    <b>Memory management</b>
    <p align = "right">
        Since Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep 
        power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation 
        so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU 
        resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the 
        system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that 
        have been inactive for the longest amount of time. Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task 
        killer applications were doing more harm than good.

        The main hardware platform for Android is the ARM (ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86, MIPS and 
        MIPS64, and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android. The unofficial 
        Android-x86 project provided support for the x86 architectures ahead of the official support. MIPS 
        architecture was also supported before Google did. Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors 
        began to appear, including phones and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was 
        first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. Since Android 5.0 "Lollipop", 64-bit variants of all 
        platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants. Requirements for the minimum amount of RAM for 
        devices running Android 7.1 range from in practice 2 GB for best hardware, down to 1 GB for the most common 
        screen, to absolute minimum 512 MB for lowest spec 32-bit smartphone. The recommendation for Android 4.4 
        is to have at least 512 MB of RAM, while for "low RAM" devices 340 MB is the required minimum amount that 
        does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor <br>

        Android 4.4 requires a 32-bit ARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports), 
        together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU). Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 
        3.0, 3.1 and as of latest major version, 3.2 and Vulkan. Some applications may explicitly require a certain 
        version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications
